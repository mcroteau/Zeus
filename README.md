# Zeus

How much is Facebook Worth? $527 billion!
That's right, almost a trillion dollars! 
While I am a fan of Harvard and the talent 
that it produces, there is a definitive pipeline 
of success that needs to be addressed.

My name is Mike Croteau, and this is my promise 
as the sole developer of Zeus, 89% of what 
Zeus earns will go towards children without homes, 
and military veterans. If you feel the need 
to give, give through Patreon.

Here is what you get as a member of Zeus, 
a promise that I will not sell your data, 
a promise of 100% transparency as I offer 
the code for Free. You can view the source 
code anytime by browsing to 
https://github.com/mcroteau/Zeus

Why should there be many to rule social 
media when there is Zeus to reign them all.

Like. Share. Kneel. Obey!
